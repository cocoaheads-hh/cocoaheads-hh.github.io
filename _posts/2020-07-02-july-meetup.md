Tom√°s Ruiz L√≥pez: How we built nef Playgrounds

nef Playgrounds is an iPad application that lets you create Swift Playgrounds using 3rd party dependencies. It's not our long time wished Xcode for iPad, but at least we can use our favorite libraries and write cool playgrounds with them. We released this app one month ago, but there is a long technical journey behind it. In this talk, I will tell the story behind this tool, and several other projects that support it. It will include both technical and management details about how the project was conceived and executed.

20:30 - Short Break

Leo Dion: Combine-ing the Old with the New

With the introduction of SwiftUI, we are seeing a major paradigm shift away from the patterns and practices such as MVC and the Delegate patterns to new patterns such as MVVM, Reactive Programming, and more. In this talk, Leo talks about how to adapt to the new Combine Subscriber-Publishers patterns to old APIs such as CoreLocation and HealthKit as well as third-party libraries like Firebase.

21:25 - Virtual get together

*Note on Jitsi Compatibility*: Jitsi is only officially supported via the iOS apps and Chrome (possibly Android apps, we weren't able to test those). While Safari seemingly works, in our experience Audio is unreliable, with people on Safari sometimes not hearing some participants while at the same time hearing others. For this reason, we recommend you use the iOS apps or Chrome, whatever suits you better.
