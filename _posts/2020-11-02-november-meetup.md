[CocoaHeads November 2020]

**When?**

Thursday, 05.11.2020, 19:00 onwards

**Where?**

REMOTE!

We're continuing to keep Cocoaheads online for this month as well üéâ
Due to the remote nature of the meetup, we're going to continue to keep it to 1 talk to encourage more participation.

*(once your RSVP for the [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Hamburg/events/jgthtrybcpbhb/) you'll be able to see the link in the event location sidebar on Meetup)*

‚è∞ Our schedule ‚è∞

As a result from the poll we shared with you last time we'll have a lighter, easier to follow (remotely) version of the CocoaHeads this time, with just 1 talk and the socialising part.

Feel free to join us via Slack, where we'll keep you up-to-date on any immediate announcements.

**Reverse Engineering UIKit as an App Developer** by *Angelo Cammalleri*  
Most of you probably have heard of reverse engineering before, but chances are that only few have tried it out. But the technique can be very helpful even for the average iOS developer and no super advanced knowledge is needed to dive right in. This talk aims to give you a short introduction on how and why to get started!  
  
Speaker Bio (*Angelo Cammalleri*)  
I have specialized in developing for Apple systems, this includes apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch.  
  
In addition I also participate in the development of videogames and apps as part of working for my own software development studio Kindred.

20:30 - Virtual get together

Social Video Links (Will be updated at event start)
**I'm in!**

*Note on Jitsi Compatibility*: Jitsi is only officially supported via the iOS apps and Chrome (possibly Android apps, we weren't able to test those). While Safari seemingly works, in our experience Audio is unreliable, with people on Safari sometimes not hearing some participants while at the same time hearing others. For this reason, we recommend you use the iOS apps or Chrome, whatever suits you better.
