[CocoaHeads October 2020]

**When?**

Thursday, 01.10.2020, 19:00 onwards

**Where?**

REMOTE!

We're continuing to keep Cocoaheads online for this month as well üéâ
We're using Jitsi, this time around as well. 

*(once your RSVP for the [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Hamburg/events/jgthtrybclbjb/) you'll be able to see the link in the event location sidebar on Meetup)*

‚è∞ Our schedule ‚è∞

As a result from the poll we shared with you last time we'll have a lighter, easier to follow (remotely) version of the CocoaHeads this time, with just 1 talk and the socialising part.

Feel free to join us via Slack, where we'll keep you up-to-date on any immediate announcements.

19:30 - Meeting starts üéâ

19:45 - 1Ô∏è‚É£
Alexander: Silicon Soul: The Machine we must not talk about

Apple introduced the Mac‚Äôs transition to ARM64, and thus the fourth CPU architecture after Motorola 68k, PowerPC and Intel.
Apart from the question what this means for the platform this is a welcome opportunity to look deep beyond the surface of technologies like SwiftUI.
Deep below we want to explore how the dynamic loader dyld brings apps to life from files containing machine code. This includes a primer into ARM64 assembler, the language now used on almost all Apple devices.
Finally there is the question: ‚ÄúHour does knowing all of this help me in my daily work?‚Äù

20:30 - Virtual get together

Social Video Links (Will be updated at event start)
**I'm in!**

*Note on Jitsi Compatibility*: Jitsi is only officially supported via the iOS apps and Chrome (possibly Android apps, we weren't able to test those). While Safari seemingly works, in our experience Audio is unreliable, with people on Safari sometimes not hearing some participants while at the same time hearing others. For this reason, we recommend you use the iOS apps or Chrome, whatever suits you better.
