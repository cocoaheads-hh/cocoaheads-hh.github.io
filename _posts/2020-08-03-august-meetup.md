[CocoaHeads August 2020]

**When?**

Thursday, 06.08.2020, 19:00 onwards

**Where?**

REMOTE!

We're continuing to keep Cocoaheads online for this month as well üéâ
We're using Jitsi, this time around as well. 

*(once your RSVP for the [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Hamburg/events/jgthtrybclbjb/) you'll be able to see the link in the event location sidebar on Meetup)*

‚è∞ Our schedule ‚è∞

As a result from the poll we shared with you last time we'll have a lighter, easier to follow (remotely) version of the CocoaHeads this time, with just 1 talk and the socialising part.

Feel free to join us via Slack, where we'll keep you up-to-date on any immediate announcements.

Peter John: The life cycle of building machine learning enabled features for mobile apps

As Mobile engineers we have a very common feature life cycle. 
90% of the time it‚Äôs implementing some kind of rest service into our apps to display some information that was calculated in a backend. 
When it comes to building ML enabled features, the life cycle works a bit differently. 
In this talk we will go through this ML life cycle, from what a ML enabled feature looks like, to building ML models for mobile, different ways to deploy these models to your app and how to monitor these models to know that it‚Äôs giving users the correct information.

20:30 - Virtual get together

Social Video Links (Will be updated at event start)

*Note on Jitsi Compatibility*: Jitsi is only officially supported via the iOS apps and Chrome (possibly Android apps, we weren't able to test those). While Safari seemingly works, in our experience Audio is unreliable, with people on Safari sometimes not hearing some participants while at the same time hearing others. For this reason, we recommend you use the iOS apps or Chrome, whatever suits you better.
