*Note on Jitsi Compatibility*: Jitsi is only officially supported via the iOS apps and Chrome (possibly Android apps, we weren't able to test those). While Safari seemingly works, in our experience Audio is unreliable, with people on Safari sometimes not hearing some participants while at the same time hearing others. For this reason, we recommend you use the iOS apps or Chrome, whatever suits you better.
