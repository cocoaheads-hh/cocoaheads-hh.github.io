**When?**

Thurday, 07.05.2020, 19:00

**Where?**

REMOTE!

As all of you know, we’re stuck at home due to Corona Virus 🦠.

About that, we hope you’re all safe and healthy, as well as you family and friends!

To keep you all distracted and to be able to talk about our favorite nerd topics, we’re not going to give up on our monthly meetup! 💪🏼

As our last months online event worked very well 🎉 we are going to meet remotely again. This time we are trying Jitsi. 
*(once your RSVPed for the [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Hamburg/events/zkldgrybchbkb/) you'll be able to see the link in the event location sidebar on Meetup)*

Also, your tips are very welcome! 🙏🏼

This months event is all about Combine!

19:45 - 1️⃣ Talk: Learning Combine by refactoring a networking layer - Donny Wals

In this talk Donny will explain the basics of Combine, and how they can be applied to refactor an existing networking layer into one that uses Combine.

Attendees will learn about Combine’s Publishers, Subscribers, operators, the Cancellable protocol and more.

20:30 - Short Break

20:40 - 2️⃣ Talk: Intro to debugging asynchronous code with Timelane - Marin Todorov

In this talk Marin will introduce us to Timelane, his custom instrument that gets integrated directly in Xcode and helps you debug async code with Combine or RxSwift.

He will cover the basics like installing, getting accustomed to the UI, and some real-life bug fixing with Timelane.

21:25 - Virtual get together

**I'm in!**

*Note on Jitsi Compatibility*: Jitsi is only officially supported via the iOS apps and Chrome (possibly Android apps, we weren't able to test those). While Safari seemingly works, in our experience Audio is unreliable, with people on Safari sometimes not hearing some participants while at the same time hearing others. For this reason, we recommend you use the iOS apps or Chrome, whatever suits you better.
