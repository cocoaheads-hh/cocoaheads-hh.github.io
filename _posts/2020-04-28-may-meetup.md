**When?**

Thurday, 07.05.2020, 19:00

**Where?**

REMOTE!

As all of you know, we’re stuck at home due to Corona Virus 🦠.

About that, we hope you’re all safe and healthy, as well as you family and friends!

To keep you all distracted and to be able to talk about our favorite nerd topics, we’re not going to give up on our monthly meetup! 💪🏼

As our last months online event worked very well 🎉 we are going to meet remotely again. We are currently evaluating different video call tools to see which one to use and will update here in time.

Also, advices and tipps from you are very welcome! 🙏🏼

This months event is all about Combine!

20:40 - 2️⃣ Talk: Intro to debugging asynchronous code with Timelane - Marin Todorov
