**When?**

Thurday, 02.04.2020, 19:00

**Where?**

REMOTE!

As all of you know, we're stuck at home due to Corona Virus 🦠. 

About that, we hope you're all safe and healthy, as well as you family and friends! 

To keep you all distracted and to be able to talk about our favorite nerd topics, we're not going to give up on our monthly meetup! 💪🏼

We planned to host the meeting on zoom this time and have so called "Breakout Rooms" to make even the socializing and networking part of the event possible.
This is the first time for us organizing something like this, so bare with us!

Also, advices and tipps from you are very welcome! 🙏🏼 

Please find the **Zoom link** on the [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/CocoaHeads-Hamburg/events/zkldgrybcgbdb/) (already)(you need to RSVP to see it) or on Slack (on the day of the meetup). Also see our [note on Zoom](#note-on-zoom) below.

**Schedule**

19:00 - Virtual "doors" open
Let's gather in Slack!

19:30 - Meeting starts 🎉
Everyone joins the Zoom session.

19:45 - 1️⃣ Talk: SwiftUI and Firebase - Peter Friese

Firebase is Google's mobile development platform for Android, iOS, and the web. SwiftUI is Apple's user interface toolkit that lets developers design apps in a declarative way. In this session, we will bring the two together and take a look at how easy it is to develop a new application from scratch.
Peter is a Developer Advocate on the Firebase team at Google, helping developers worldwide to build better apps using Firebase and other technologies.

20:30 - Short Break

20:40 - 2️⃣ Talk: Things I wish I knew before I started working Remote! - Mario Stallone

With the advancements in Video Conferencing solutions and jobs that do not need constant in-person communication, remote work has seen a rise in recent years. I've bene working remotely for the last 2.5 yrs, and I do this for a team that works 9 timezones behind me. In this talk, I'll walk through my journey, while trying to give you a balanced view of the Good and the Bad sides of working remote, and how to overcome some of these issues. In short, these are things I wish I knew before I started working Remote 🙂
Given the current wfh situation we all are under, I hope that my experience might help you in this situation.

21:10 - Virtual get together

**I'm in!**

#### Note on Zoom
Zoom has a [history of privacy violations and generally shady behavior](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1244997990382596096). However, it is also currently the most easy-to-setup tool for a group of our size. We'll look for alternatives for future meetups, but until then, we advise you *not to install Zoom on your Mac*. We believe the iOS client to be sufficiently safe due to sandboxing. You can also [use Zoom just from the browser](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005666383-Show-a-Join-from-your-browser-Link) ([requires Chrome, audio doesn't work with Firefox + Safari](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629443)).
