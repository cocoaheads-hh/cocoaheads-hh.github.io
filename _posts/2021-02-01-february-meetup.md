[CocoaHeads Februrary 2021]

**When?**

Thursday, 04.02.20201, 19:00 onwards

**Where?**

REMOTE!

We're continuing to keep Cocoaheads online for this month as well 🎉
We're trying something different this time, and keeping it a more social event. We do not have a talk this time, instead we'd all get together and share our thoughts, tips and suggestions on a given topic.

This month's topic - The Future of Work!

*(once your RSVP for the [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Hamburg/events/jgthtrybcpbhb/) you'll be able to see the link in the event location sidebar on Meetup)*

⏰ Our schedule ⏰

Feel free to join us via Slack, where we'll keep you up-to-date on any immediate announcements.

*Note on Jitsi Compatibility*: Jitsi is only officially supported via the iOS apps and Chrome (possibly Android apps, we weren't able to test those). While Safari seemingly works, in our experience Audio is unreliable, with people on Safari sometimes not hearing some participants while at the same time hearing others. For this reason, we recommend you use the iOS apps or Chrome, whatever suits you better.
